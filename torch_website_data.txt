As Torch continues to grow, so does our corporate charitable giving. We structured our corporate giving into two levels: the Corporate Charitable Giving Committee, and large corporate commitments. Our Corporate Charitable Giving Committee, a voluntary committee of employee-owners, meets quarterly to review all applicable charitable requests and provide recommendations. Our Corporate Charitable Giving Committee receives and recommends charitable requests for those organizations that do not meet the requirements for a Torch Helps grant. Torch has supported organizations including Still Serving Veterans, Junior Achievement, the Huntsville Art League, the Huntsville/Madison County Veterans Park, Early Works Family Museum, Cooks Natural History Museum, Christmas Charities Year-Round, the National Association of Black Engineers, and many, many more.
Torch regularly commits to large corporate donations in support of our local communities, in addition to the funds granted by the Corporate Charitable Giving Committee. These commitments are made as long-term investments in our communities. Some of the recent large corporate commitments include: a local library campaign, the Huntsville Madison County Veterans Memorial, the Madison County Military Heritage Commission,Early Works Children's Museum, the Community Foundation of Greater Huntsville's Summer Adventures in Learning program, and the Community Foundation of Greater Huntsville's CAP & GOWN Project.
Torch also encourages community involvement through our sponsorship and participation in events including local Heart Walks for the American Heart Association, runs for breast cancer, the ALS Walk, academic competitions, robotics teams, and more.

Further, we coordinate annual golf tournaments that benefit local charities in several of our locations. These fun events for our employee-owners, customers, and friends are not only great employee morale events, but also a fun way to give back to our community. In 2022, our event included 200 golfers from multiple companies and organizations.Through the combined generosity of our incredible sponsors, golfers, volunteers, Torch’s employee-owners and Board of Directors, as well as the employee-owners and Board of Directors of our sister and parent companies Freedom Real Estate and Starfish Holdings, we were able to present the Village of Promise with a $105,000 donation!
Torch Technologies committed to the Community Foundation of Greater Huntsville to provide the inaugural leadership gift and be the “Torchbearer” founding contributor to the CF’s Catalyst Fund. The Community Catalyst Fund (CCF) is an investment in the quality of life in Huntsville/Madison County. More about the fund is included below. Torch’s commitment of $150,000 helped the CF provide matching funds and momentum in raising the $1M required to endow the fund, which will allow a continuing positive impact on our community in perpetuity.
Based on the outcome of the "Community Vital Signs" project of the Community Foundation of Greater Huntsville, strategic, visionary projects which will have a significant and sustainable impact on quality of life in the Community will be identified and prioritized. The Board of the Community Foundation of Greater Huntsville will select project(s) to be undertaken each year, and the selected project(s) will be led by the Community Foundation of Greater Huntsville. Seed funding from the CCF will be leveraged with other public and/or private funding sources to meet project funding requirements. A project team will be assembled from nonprofit agencies and possibly local government agencies to collaboratively execute the project. The goal is to 'move the needle' on measurable community health indicators as determined by the Vital Signs project.

Midway through their careers, Bill Roark and Don Holder had both worked for a highly successful company when it was sold. For months, Roark invited Holder to breakfast and discussed starting a new company with him. Both had felt they had made commitments to valued employees in the past that they were powerless to honor after the acquisition. To prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future, Roark and Holder envisioned a business that would become an employee owned company through which its employees would have better control of their destinies. Through a phone call on his way to the University of Oklahoma for an Alabama Crimson Tide football game, Holder finally accepted Roark's offer to join the startup in early September 2002. The new company started in a modest suite at 2705 Artie St. that included a few offices and a conference room. The night before, "the company didn't even have desks," said Roark, who bought and assembled some desks from Staples and also purchased some used furniture.
Since those early days, the company's success has skyrocketed. Torch Technologies has more than 1,200 employee owners and finished 2020 with $550 million in revenue, making Torch one of the largest federal contractors in the nation. We believe that level of success is achieved by giving every employee owner a stake in the outcome.

In this episode, we sit down with two leaders making a powerful impact in the Huntsville community—Darren Geiger, President & CEO of Family Services Center, and Shirley Schofield, CEO of the Food Bank of North Alabama.
They share how their organizations are addressing core issues like food insecurity, homelessness, mental health, and family support through a wide range of services—from workforce development and grief counseling to food distribution and school partnerships. With Huntsville’s rapid growth, both organizations are navigating increased demand while emphasizing the importance of collaboration, data-driven impact, and diversified funding strategies.
We explore the realities their clients face, how their missions have evolved, and what their biggest needs are heading into 2025. Whether it’s providing shelter, serving 80,000+ people each month with food, or connecting families with vital resources, Darren and Shirley are on the front lines of building a stronger, more supportive community.
If you’re looking for ways to give back, get involved, or better understand the human needs in our region—this is a conversation you won’t want to miss.

Hollywood, Ala., February 21, 2025– Jackson County Schools hosted a SIMVANA Demo Day today at the Kevin Dukes Career and Innovation Academy (KDCIA), showcasing the transformative impact of industry-education partnerships. The event highlighted how collaborations like the one between Jackson County Schools and SIMVANA, a sister company to Torch Technologies headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, are equipping students with cutting-edge career skills. In 2024, Jackson County Schools partnered with SIMVANA to integrate its virtual reality (VR) nurse anesthetist training into KDCIA’s Health Sciences program.
“This partnership is enabling us to get technology into the classroom much faster than traditional methods,” said Jackson County Schools Superintendent Jason Davidson. “Health Sciences is one of our largest programs, and through this collaboration, our students can explore anesthesia as a potential career while still in high school. This hands-on experience allows them to assess their skills and interest in the field—an opportunity that was previously unavailable.”
The American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology predicts that the anesthesiology workforce will experience a significant shortage of qualified practitioners by 2033, with rural communities expected to be disproportionately affected.
“We are pleased to partner with the Jackson County School System and KDCIA,” said Darryl Trousdale, Program Manager of Torch Technologies Advanced VIZLAB and Co-founder of SIMVANA. “SIMVANA Anesthesia has revolutionized simulation training at the college level across the US and is now being leveraged at the K-12 level to inspire the next generation of anesthesia providers. The potential applications of this technology extend far beyond anesthesia. While today’s focus is on anesthesia careers, our immersive VR training can be adapted for a wide range of industries, opening doors for students across multiple career paths.”
Recent surveys conducted by SIMVANA with local Career Day participants demonstrated the program’s impact. Findings revealed that 36% of students who experienced SIMVANA Anesthesia expressed a strong interest in pursuing a career as an anesthesia provider, highlighting the effectiveness of immersive learning in career exploration.“This is the future of education,” added Davidson. “Career Tech and college readiness are converging, and innovative tools like SIMVANA Anesthesia are helping students discover fulfilling career opportunities. Our partnership is making this vision a reality in Jackson County, and we hope today’s event inspires other school systems across North Alabama to adopt similar technology-driven initiatives.”

Torch Technologies finds that certain core attributes are routinely used to describe the company and our employees. We reinforce our desire to maintain this reputation with every individual we hire, every business relationship we begin and with every client we serve.
Torch maintains a “cutting-edge” atmosphere that encourages employee creativity and thinking outside the box and allows them the freedom to take the necessary risks to implement these ideas.
Torch employees exhibit an unselfish will to achieve common corporate and customer goals as well as to help others succeed.
Torch employees achieve the highest levels of performance, always striving to exceed company and customer expectations.
Torch employees recognize that we exist to support our customers and act accordingly by knowing who our customers are and understanding their requirements and needs.
Torch employees strive to be world-renowned leaders in their fields of expertise, continuously upgrade their knowledge base and staying abreast of technological advancements and innovations.
Torch employees are honest, trustworthy, and dependable and always strive to “do the right thing.” They lead by example and always act in a way to uphold Torch corporate ethics and our reputation.
Torch employees are dependable and consistently lend their efforts to solve the problems at hand and to support the goals of the organization and our customers.
Torch Technologies will help our clients exceed their goals in the most cost-effective and time-efficient manner given their own technology, schedule, and financial constraints. Through our determined effort, our Torch employees are Lighting the Pathway of Freedom.
When Bill Roark and Don Holder founded Torch in 2002, they knew that employees were the company's greatest asset. They believed that offering employees a stake in the outcome, by making them all owners, was critical to building a successful organization. I share that feeling. Bill and Don's original intent was fully achieved in 2011 when Torch converted to a 100 percent S-Corp ESOP. Since that time, the company has grown over ten-fold and gained national recognition for the success we have demonstrated as an employee-owned company.
Today, Torch continues to respect the individual contributions of our employee-owners and to share the rewards of our success. In addition, we continue to foster an environment of employee recognition, respect, development, and comradery while striving to achieve a healthy work-life balance. We recognize that core to our company is a culture of trust with our employees, customers, business partners, and community. Our management team is committed to continue to earn that trust. This past year, Torch proudly announced that we were Certified Evergreen™. A timely achievement for Torch employee-owners as they will celebrate Torch’s 20th anniversary this October, becoming Certified Evergreen™ signifies that while Torch employee-owners can look back on Torch’s past with pride, Torch is also looking forward. Becoming Certified Evergreen™ means that Torch has committed to finding ways to make 100 percent employee ownership sustainable so that Torch will remain a private company forever.
Going forward, Torch will continue to evolve to address market and technology changes in order to become a major provider of cost-effective technical services and solutions to the Warfighter. We are making significant investments into facilities, equipment, business systems, and research to enable us to provide innovations and timely business services to our clients. We feel that always looking to improve our service is key to sustaining customer trust in the future. Likewise, we believe that continuing to share ownership is one of the ways we maintain employee trust and an unparalleled commitment to succeed. Combined, these timeless principles form the basis of the Torch culture. A culture that we are committed to continue and strive to pass on to the next generation of employee-owners as an Evergreen Company.

Torch in Action, the service and outreach arm of Torch Helps, has coordinated several volunteer opportunities for our employee-owners since its inception in 2005. The main scope of Torch in Action is to provide Torch employees opportunities to volunteer in the local community by sharing information concerning available small scale service projects as well as planning, organizing, and implementing larger scale service-oriented projects.
What We Do Torch in Action provides no financial support, it is instead focused on giving back through service. Torch in Action has participated in Salute to Service, Relay for Life, yard cleanup days at 305 8th Street, worked at food distribution centers organizing donated items, built ramps with the Care Assurance System for the Aging and Homebound for the elderly, hosted food, clothing, medical supplies, coats, and book drives, adopted angels from the Salvation Army angel tree, volunteered ringing bells for the Salvation Army, helped establish a STEM Lab for a local Boys & Girls Club, and ultimately helped make employee-owners aware of volunteer opportunities in the community.
GET INTO ACTION
Torch in Action advocates for service within our communities. Our employees have given back to their communities in many ways. We are active in our churches, schools and many volunteer organizations. We are parents, brothers, sisters, friends, mentors, advisors, grandparents, and so much more. We have created a work environment that reinforces the fact that coaching tee-ball is far more important than a management strategy session. After all, what value is it to earn a living if you do not take the time to have a life?

Torch possesses prototyping capabilities in electromechanical, mechanical, optical, and software systems. We perform state-of-the-art research, development, design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of electronic, electromechanical, and mechanical partial and full-scale systems. We use the results in concept development, proof of concept, component integration, and live system test and evaluation. We conduct electronic design and fabrication at all levels, including breadboard, brassboard, and flight-qualified printed circuit board (PCB). Results are integrated with mechanical design and machined assemblies to make final test articles. Our delivered systems include multipurpose miniaturized airborne data logger, specialized airborne underwing video pods, multi-band optical flight hardware, sensor registration algorithms, and UAS/weapons control software. These programs involve an extensive use of inexpensive commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software components.
Robotics, AI, Sensing and Systems (RASS) Rover - The RASS Rover was developed in TIPC to evaluate sensors and mapping algorithms to test autonomous operation that is necessary for exploration and construction of lunar habitats. Mechanical mounting systems and electronics required for the sensors were also designed, manufactured, and integrated within TIPC.
Tethered Aerial Persistent Platform System - TAPPS is a tethered, quad-rotor UAV, that can carry a heavy payload at high altitude for an extended duration. The strong, light-weight tether carries power from the ground and contains a fiber optic cable that provides high bandwidth, secure communications with the platform and sensors. TAPPs’ ultra-light weight design makes it rapidly deployable and highly maneuverable.

Torch applies traditional and non-traditional interdisciplinary engineering expertise to advance the Warfighter’s “art of the possible” in broad domains of weapons, manned and unmanned platforms, software, sensors, data fusion, management, and systems integration. We promote collaboration across government/contractor lines and empower our team to be innovative in our approach to fulfilling technical requirements and engineering solutions. We excel at experimentation and acceleration of technology in lab environments fully using high-level prototyping possible to reduce risk, but always with a focus on field application.
Our engineers are experienced in designing electronic, mechanical, and optical systems. Through our Technology Integration and Prototyping Center (TIPC), we can rapidly produce, integrate, and test complex product prototypes. For turnkey solutions, our engineering teams create detailed project schedules to mitigate risk and conducts regular in-progress reviews to ensure the final design will meet expectations.
We assign multi-disciplinary engineering teams to develop solutions and equip them with design tools, configuration management systems, and in-house fabrication resources needed to ensure success. These teams are also paired with specialists who understand the operational and logistical needs to make a solution successful in the field. This work environment has enabled our team to successfully fabricate large-scale prototypes at rapid pace. One such program received limited airworthiness certification in only six months after fabrication began. Other applications include:
Torch maintains memberships in multiple DoD and industry consortia. As a member of the Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium (DOTC), our goal is to collaborate among Government, industry partners, and Academia for purposes of ordnance technology development and prototyping. As an active member of the National Advanced Mobility Consortium (NAMC), Torch’s goal is to provide advanced research in a broad range of ground vehicle, autonomous, and system technologies.

When Bill Roark and Don Holder founded Torch in 2002, they knew that employees were the company's greatest asset. They believed that offering employees a stake in the outcome, by making them all owners, was critical to building a successful organization. I share that feeling. Bill and Don's original intent was fully achieved in 2011 when Torch converted to a 100 percent S-Corp ESOP. Since that time, the company has grown over ten-fold and gained national recognition for the success we have demonstrated as an employee-owned company.
Today, Torch continues to respect the individual contributions of our employee-owners and to share the rewards of our success. In addition, we continue to foster an environment of employee recognition, respect, development, and comradery while striving to achieve a healthy work-life balance. We recognize that core to our company is a culture of trust with our employees, customers, business partners, and community. Our management team is committed to continue to earn that trust. This past year, Torch proudly announced that we were Certified Evergreen™. A timely achievement for Torch employee-owners as they will celebrate Torch’s 20th anniversary this October, becoming Certified Evergreen™ signifies that while Torch employee-owners can look back on Torch’s past with pride, Torch is also looking forward. Becoming Certified Evergreen™ means that Torch has committed to finding ways to make 100 percent employee ownership sustainable so that Torch will remain a private company forever.
Going forward, Torch will continue to evolve to address market and technology changes in order to become a major provider of cost-effective technical services and solutions to the Warfighter. We are making significant investments into facilities, equipment, business systems, and research to enable us to provide innovations and timely business services to our clients. We feel that always looking to improve our service is key to sustaining customer trust in the future. Likewise, we believe that continuing to share ownership is one of the ways we maintain employee trust and an unparalleled commitment to succeed. Combined, these timeless principles form the basis of the Torch culture. A culture that we are committed to continue and strive to pass on to the next generation of employee-owners as an Evergreen Company.

Torch Helps, an employee-run and funded 501(c)(3) charitable organization, has provided grants to more than 125 local charities since its inception in June 2005. Torch Helps is voluntarily funded and operated by Torch employees. It raises contributions for local charities through payroll deduction and designated gifts. The organization operates under the direction of a volunteer review board, which receives formal grant applications from charities that are then evaluated against a consistent set of questions to screen applicants. Applicants are also evaluated against the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance Standards for Charity Accountability. When a charity passes these standards, the charities are voted on by contributing employees. The highest calling in life is to help others. Torch supports our employees' charitable efforts by covering all of the administrative costs of Torch Helps. Thus, 100 percent of the donations to Torch Helps goes to the organizations selected by the employees. Torch Helps believes that "Together Our Resources Can Help." This captures the spirit and inspiration of Torch's culture of giving. To date, Torch Helps has given more than $1.3 million to our local communities.
To date, Torch Helps has provided more than 1.3 million dollars in direct grants. Of course, the real impact is not measured in dollars and cents. It is reflected in the young mother who now has her own home and a dream to start her own business. It is felt by the disabled lady who no longer has to suffer the sweltering heat of a long, dry summer. It is honored by the Boy Scout Troop who decided to give half their new camping gear to a troop that was affected by Hurricane Katrina. We may never see most of the people whose lives have been made a little better by the small amounts that we give every two weeks, but we consider it an honor to support the local charities and their volunteers who do.
Torch Helps awards large and small grants to local charities who are making a difference in our communities. Charities must be nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations that provide services to our local communities. Visit TorchHelps.org for additional qualification requirements. A Torch Helps grant application form must be completed in full before a charity can be included in the vote.

Just months after Torch Helps was established, one of its first efforts was assisting survivors of Hurricane Katrina around Waveland, MS, the hometown of a senior manager at Torch. “I knew I had to do something; I didn’t know what,” he said about learning of the devastation along the Gulf Coast. He soon headed to the Mississippi coast in his van, hauling a utility trailer with food, tents, clothing, gasoline, and propane tanks. After he returned to Huntsville, the urge to help still lingered, particularly a childhood friend who was the sheriff of a hard-hit area. The Torch senior manager appealed to Torch Helps, and the organization received significant contributions from Torch customers, colleagues, and original investors.
Torch employees also collected items and put together care packages to send to disaster victims. In all, $10,000 in cash and equipment such as generators, chain saws, and propane tanks were donated to the relief effort.

Budget constraints continue to challenge Department of Defense programs requiring new and innovative approaches to reduce training cost and increase efficiency. Fortunately, the gaming industry is providing opportunities for the DoD to capitalize on massive commercial Research & Development in technologies that are directly transferable to the development of virtual training products. These technologies allow the development of interactive environments that can complement training and reduce the number of high-cost hardware trainers required, significantly reducing overall program training cost. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software is available which allows rapid development of prototypes that are exportable to numerous platforms to include Personal Computer, mobile, tablet, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality.
The Advanced Vizlab is staffed by some of the industry’s most talented engineers and artists and consists of video production equipment and commercial game development tools. The laboratory also houses state-of-the-art mixed-reality devices and facilities that Torch uses to stay on the leading edge of virtual training trends.
Torch manages, develops, and validates a variety of simulations and simulation tools, including emulators and simulators, to facilitate a complete understanding of the operational system environment. We develop simulations based on complex mathematical and phenomenology models for a variety of problem domains including the following: platform; interceptor; threat sensor; and Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4). Torch incorporates these complex models into larger system simulations for analysis of system-wide problems in a variety of areas such as integrated air and missile defense, ballistic missile defense sensor and weapon performance, and integrated UAS weapon system performance.
Torch developed an innovative multi-spectral simulation software and modeling process that takes advantage of modern massively parallel hardware. Traditional terrain scene modeling solutions often require 2-4 weeks of execution time on a High-Performance Compute cluster, while Torch’s solution completes the same work on a single computer using high performance GPU’s in less than 24 hours. Our solution drastically reduced runtime allowed for many fidelity enhancements that were previously not feasible. Torch has also developed multi-spectral topography models for EO/IR and RF bands in denied areas. These advanced technologies have broad applications in the development of advanced seekers, detection systems, and active protection systems.
