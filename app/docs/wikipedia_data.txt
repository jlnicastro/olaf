Torch Technologiesis an employee-owned system engineering, applied science, modeling & simulation and information technology business. Its primary customers are theUnited States Army Aviation and Missile Command(AMCOM) and theMissile Defense Agency, although it has contracts with otherDoDagencies including theNavyand theAir Force.[1]Torch has over 1100 employee-owners and is headquartered inHuntsville, AL, with technical offices located inAberdeen, MD,Albuquerque, NM,Boston, MA,Colorado Springs, CO,Detroit, MI,Honolulu, HI,Patuxent River, MD, andShalimar, FL.[2]
Torch Technologies was co-founded in 2002 in Huntsville, AL by Bill Roark and Don Holder. Roark and Holder respectively had 30 and 40 years of experience in the Department of Defense research and development programs and other contracts.[3]The company's location was chosen due to its proximity toRedstone Arsenal, which serves as headquarters of several largeArmyorganizations such asAMCOMand offices belonging toUS Army Aviation.[4]Upon the company's formation, the co-founders began to aggressively recruit a team of senior engineers, and set out to build a reputation for good service and competitive pricing. In 2005, Roark began to take steps that allowed Torch to become employee-owned (via anESOP), and the company attained 100% employee ownership in 2010.[5]Roark desired employee-ownership andprofit sharingbecause such management styles have been proven to reduceemployee attrition ratesand increasejob satisfaction.[6]In 2008, Torch began bidding as a prime government contractor. With the receipt of four direct award prime task orders on AMCOM Express, the company won more contracts in two weeks in late 2008 than the previous six years of combined government work.[3]In late 2016, Torch completed a $12 million renovation of the two existing buildings it owns inSouth Huntsville.[7]Torch received economic incentives from the city of Huntsville, theTennessee Valley Authorityand thestate of Alabamato keep its headquarters in south Huntsville as opposed to moving toCummings Research Parkin hopes of growing economic activity in the immediate area.[7]Torch has since had two more major expansions in south Huntsville, with the (2017) completion of a conference center called the Freedom Center[8]and the (2019) completion of the Technology Integration & Prototyping Center.[9]While Torch is headquartered in Huntsville, with eight technical offices located throughout the United States, they have employee-owners located in several additional markets, includingCalifornia;Ohio,Oklahoma,Massachusetts,Pennsylvania,Texas,Virginia,Kwajalein, andEgypt.
